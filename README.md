# CTD-ehri-API-querier
Scripts to support the delivery of Discovery catalogue records to the EHRI portal

The script expects a folder called output at the same level as the python files. The tsv files generated by the system will be output there, one for each series being processed. 
It also looks for a series.txt file. In it you put the list of series, one of each line, that you want to get the record urls for.

The script will read the list of series in the series.txt file query discovery for the ids for that series and output the URLs and ids into a TSV file.
